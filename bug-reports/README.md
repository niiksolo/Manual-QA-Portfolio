# Bug Reports

All bugs were initially documented in **Jira**, and then moved here for easier viewing.  

## Structure
- Each bug report is stored in a separate `.md` file.  
- Screenshots are located in the `screenshots/` folder and are included in the reports using `<img>` tags.  
- The `jira-overview.md` file contains a screenshot confirming that all bugs were actually created and tracked in **Jira**. If needed, I can show them directly in Jira.  

## Bug Report Template
Each report includes:  
- **ID** — unique bug number  
- **Project** — module the bug belongs to  
- **Priority & Severity** — priority and severity  
- **Environment** — OS and browser  
- **Description** — problem description  
- **Steps to Reproduce** — steps to reproduce the bug  
- **Expected Result** — expected outcome  
- **Actual Result** — actual outcome  
- **Attachments** — screenshots
