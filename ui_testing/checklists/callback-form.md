# Checklist: Callback Form (KS-Trans)

## General Checks
☐ The **“Callback”** button is visible in the header and footer.  
☐ Clicking the button opens the callback form.  
☐ The form is correctly centered on the screen (not covered by other elements).  

## Form Fields
☐ The **“Name”** and **“Phone”** fields are displayed correctly.  
☐ Data can be entered into the fields (text and numbers).  
☐ The **Phone** field triggers a numeric keyboard on mobile devices.  

## Validation
☐ Submitting an empty form is not possible — an error message appears.  
☐ If the **Phone** field is filled but **Name** is empty → error appears, and vice versa.  
☐ Letters or invalid values cannot be entered into the **Phone** field.  
☐ Entering an incorrect phone number (less than 9 digits) shows an error.  

## Form Submission
☐ The **“Send”** button is active only when all fields are correctly filled.  
☐ After successful submission, the message **“Thank you for your request”** appears.  
☐ The form closes after submission.  

## UI / Responsiveness
☐ The form displays correctly on mobile devices.  
☐ The keyboard does not cover the **“Send”** button.  
☐ All elements are easy to tap with a finger.
