# Checklist: Order a Trip (KS-Trans)

## Navigation from Routes Sections
☐ On the homepage, clicking the "Details" button of a selected route opens the corresponding route page.  
☐ URL matches the route name.  
☐ Route name is visible on the opened page.

## Route Page
☐ Route title displays the country (Poland, Bulgaria, etc.) and directions.  
☐ Route description lists departure and arrival cities.  
☐ Features are shown (Wi-Fi, Air Conditioning, TV, Cabin Heating, etc.).  
☐ Images/icons of features load correctly (not distorted).  
☐ Description text is readable and correct (no errors).

## Booking or Next-Step Button
☐ "Book" button is present.  
☐ Button is clickable and opens the booking form.  
☐ Clicking the button displays the booking form.

## Booking Form
☐ Form fields ("Contact Person", "Phone", "Email") are displayed correctly.  
☐ All required fields are clearly marked for the user.  
☐ Fields accept input without errors (text, numbers, email).  
☐ Submitting an empty form shows an error message.  
☐ Filling in the phone but leaving the name empty → shows an error, and vice versa.  
☐ Phone field does not accept letters or incorrect format (e.g., `123` or `abcd`).  
☐ Email field validates correct format (must contain @ and a domain).  
☐ "Submit" button is active only when fields are correctly filled.  
☐ After submission, the user is redirected to the "Thank you for your order" page.

## Overall Logic
☐ Navigation is logical — homepage → route → booking.  
☐ No broken links or 404 errors during the booking process.  
☐ User always understands the current stage (route name, clear buttons, readable text).
